Feature: Service Template
  As a Travel Specialist of Ventura Travel, I want to work with Service Templates.

  Background:
    Given that the Admin navigates to the homepage of the New GO platform
    And he enters his user 'mauricio.ramirez@venturatravel.org' and password 'M@uricio69'
 #  And that the Admin edits the 'Mauricio Ramirez' info
 #  And he adds a new role 'SENIOR'
 #  And he log outs
 #  And he enters his user 'mauricio.ramirez@venturatravel.org' and password 'M@uricio69'


  @CreateServiceTemplate
  Scenario Outline: Create a new Service Template.
    When that the TS creates the template '<service template>'
#    Then '<service template>' should be recorded in his template list
#
#
#    Examples:
#      | Platform | service template |
#      | New GO   | QA_test          |

#  @DeleteServiceTemplate
#  Scenario Outline: Delete a new Service Template.
#    When that the TS deletes the template '<service template>'
#    Then '<service template>' should be recorded in his template list
##   Then he deletes the template '<service template>'
##   And he does not see the template '<service template>' created

   Examples:
     | Platform | service template |
     | New GO   | QA_test          |
